/*

							!!! 8 Queens Problem !!!

States: 1 <= state <= 8
		At any given point of time, the board would contain atleast
		1 queen and atmost 8 queens.

Initial State: Initially, a single queen is placed on the board,
		starting from the top-left corner of the board.

Function: The queens must be placed on the board such that it is not
		under attack by the rest of the queens presently on the board.

Goal State: All the 8 queens are successfully placed on the board
		such that no queen is under attack by any of the rest 7 queens
		on the board at any pint of time.

Path cost: 1 per level. At depth 1, the cost is 1,
		at depth 2, the cost is 2 and so on. The depth of the tree 
		would atmost be 8 since there are 8 queens. Therefore the 
		total path cost for the solution would be 8.
